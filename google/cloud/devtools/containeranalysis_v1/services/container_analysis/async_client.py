        r"""Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note
        or occurrence. Requires list permission on the project (for
        example, ``containeranalysis.notes.list``).

        The resource takes the format
        ``projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]`` for notes and
        ``projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]`` for
        occurrences.

        Args:
            request (:class:`~.iam_policy.TestIamPermissionsRequest`):
                The request object. Request message for
                `TestIamPermissions` method.
            resource (:class:`str`):
                REQUIRED: The resource for which the
                policy detail is being requested. See
                the operation documentation for the
                appropriate value for this field.
                This corresponds to the ``resource`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            permissions (:class:`Sequence[str]`):
                The set of permissions to check for the ``resource``.
                Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*')
                are not allowed. For more information see `IAM
                Overview <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions>`__.
                This corresponds to the ``permissions`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            ~.iam_policy.TestIamPermissionsResponse:
                Response message for ``TestIamPermissions`` method.
